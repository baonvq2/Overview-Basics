# Overview
This is my very 1st repo on this Github. The purpose of this Github is mainly revolving around code storage stemming from different real projects (those are collected from my work at different companies)

Also, this would be the representative of what I have mentioned in my resume/curriculum vitae in a detailed way. Hope this help.

In this 'overview/basics' repo, I will note down some initial instructions (really spontaneous stuff) that I have collected throughout the time as a reminder for future-me in case I forget.
